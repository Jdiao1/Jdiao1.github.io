# Learning Fastai and PyTorch for CNNs with Python and Jupyter Notebook

Fastai is a high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. 
It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for training state-of-the-art deep learning models with minimal code. 
Fastai simplifies many common deep learning tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and results interpretation.

#Installing Fastai

install fastai using pip:

<pip install fastai>
# Getting Started with Fastai and using examples

To get started with fastai, using duckduckgo search to find example images.
from fastbook installed we will use the search_images_ddg function from there to fetch images

#Going through example
00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb gives a great explanation into using the fast ai library, I will not go into detail for every single line of code written there but to summarise:
1. Great fastai library and demonstrated its ease of use for building deep learning models.
2. Fastai's high-level APIs and rich functionality make it a powerful tool for rapid prototyping and experimentation in deep learning projects
3. simplifies many common tasks, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on the core aspects of their models and experiments
